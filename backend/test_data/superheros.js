As king of his home nation Wakanda, his fights are not in the streets but against threats to his throne, nation, and even the global geopolitical balance.

Not a ‘superhero’ per se, but more of a normal guy with the superhuman ability to fire arrows and bows with extreme precision and accuracy; Hawkeye has helped defeat multiple enemies with his fine skills. He has spectacular eyesight and hand-eye coordination, can fire multiple arrows in a few seconds, and directly hit small targets in far distances.

A hunter by instinct and skilled martial artist and swordsman, he perhaps knows more than any other mutant (thanks to his long life) how distrustful people can be. Wolverine’s strength is enough to break steel and lift weights that no normal human could. With animal-senses that can hear and see more than that of an ordinary person, a healing power like no other, and claws for days, Wolverine is one that goes down in history.",

The angrier he gets, the more strength he builds. With superhuman muscle power and lungs, Hulk has the ability to lift mountains and planets, travel miles in just one jump, breathe underwater and withstand bullets.
